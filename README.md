This extension provides a visual interface for your Gradle build. You can use this interface to view Gradle Tasks and Project dependencies, or run Gradle Tasks as VS Code Task.


Install these extensions and restart the Vscode.

## Spring Boot

Spring Boot is a framework that cames to reduce the significant time and knowledge to configure, set up, and deploy Spring applications.

Spring is one of the most popular open source framework for the Java platform created by Rod Johnson and described in his book "Expert One-on-One: JEE Design and Development". It is a non-intrusive framework, based on inversion of control and dependency injection design patterns.

### Open the  Spring Boot project in VSCode


This will create and configure a a new spring boot project in the VSCode

#### Environments Variables

In some cases, it is necessary to use Environments Variables to project sensitive data, like database user and password.

In the VsCode, we configure this information in a **launch.json** file under **.vscode** directory.  To create a launch.json file, click the "create a launch.json file" link in the Run start view.

In the launch file, add the enviroments variables values. Do not commit this file, add it to **.gitignore** file.
